	Module : dualpriorenc
	- Input signals
		# in - 12 bit signal for encoding
	
	- Output signnals
		# first - 4 bit signal telling the first encoded priority signal number
		# second - 4 bit signal telling the second encoded priority signal number
		
	- Intermediate signals
		# prior - 4 bit signal storing the first encoded priority signal number (i.e. value of first)  
		
		
	Module : priorencoder
	-Input signals
		# in - 12 bit signal for encoding
		# prior - 4 bit signal telling which priority has been encoded. Zero means no priority encoded.
		
	-Output signals
		# out - 4 bit signal telling the first priority encoded signal number
		
	-Intermediate signals
		# inI - 12 bit signal, storing the modified value of in signal according to the value of prior signal. (the bit position of in signal pointed by prior is made zero)
