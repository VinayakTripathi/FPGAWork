1. dualpriorityencoder.v

	Module : dualpriorenc
	- Input signals
		# in - 12 bit signal for encoding
	
	- Output signnals
		# first - 4 bit signal telling the first encoded priority signal number
		# second - 4 bit signal telling the second encoded priority signal number
		
	- Intermediate signals
		# prior - 4 bit signal storing the first encoded priority signal number (i.e. value of first)  
		
		
	Module : priorencoder
	-Input signals
		# in - 12 bit signal for encoding
		# prior - 4 bit signal telling which priority has been encoded. Zero means no priority encoded.
		
	-Output signals
		# out - 4 bit signal telling the first priority encoded signal number
		
	-Intermediate signals
		# inI - 12 bit signal, storing the modified value of in signal according to the value of prior signal. (the bit position of in signal pointed by prior is made zero)
	
2. modifiedbarrelshifter.v

	Module : modified_barrel_shift
	- Input signals
		# In - 8 bit signal on which shift has to be performed
		# Num - 3 bit signal, telling the amount of shift required
		# LR - 1 bit signal telling whether to perform right or left shift. (0-right 1-left)
		
	- Output signals
		# Out - 8 bit signal storing the shifted result
		
	- Intermediate signals
		# OutR - 8 bit signal storing right shifted signal
		# OutL - 8 bit signal storing right shifted signal
